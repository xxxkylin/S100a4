## S100a4: Database of A/J mouse model and human samples
Welcome to a repository for storing human and mice scRNA-seq data. We store the data for article **S100a4+alveolar macrophages accelerate the progress of precancerous atypical adenomatous hyperplasia by promoting the angiogenic function regulated by fatty acid metabolism.**(https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.101731.2)

Storing human and mice scRNA-seq data.
- human: huaman data
  Human clinical specimens from ten patients were enrolled with informed consent from West China Hospital. All samples were obtained during surgery and prior to any other treatment. Histological classification of precancerous lesions and tumors was determined according to the WHO guidelines (Travis et al., 2015). Fresh specimens were instantly divided into two pieces for single cell suspension preparation and histopathological staining. The utilization of human samples was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board of West China Hospital, with all participants providing written informed consents.
- mice: mice data
  A/J mice were obtained from Shanghai Model Organisms Center (Shanghai, China). The 200 mice were divided into groups and housed in an air-conditioned room with a 12-h light/dark cycle and standard chow diet. Mice were killed by decapitation at different months of age. A gross examination of all organs was conducted, the lungs were removed and bisected for tissue fixation and the preparation of single cell suspensions. All the animal surgical and experimental procedures were approved by the Ethics Board of Experimental Animals, West China Hospital, Sichuan University (Approval No. 20230208003).
